# raspp - Assembly Preprocessor in Ruby

**raspp** is a minimal text preprocessor with the full power of the
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) programming language.  What requires a
specific directive in other preprocessors is typically just a Ruby statement
in raspp.

While originally intended as a preprocessor for assembly language, raspp is
general enough that it could be useful for other purposes.

This code is experimental and might be broken.  Use at your own risk.
